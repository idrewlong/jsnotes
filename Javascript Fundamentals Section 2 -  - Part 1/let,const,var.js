// We use let to declare variables that can change later
let age = 30;
age = 31;

// const is a variable that doesn't change
const birthYear = 1996;

// var should avoided but need to know how it works
// var is the old way of defining variables from before ES6, works the same way as let.
// the value of the variable can be changed
// var is function scoped

var job = "programmer";
job = "teacher";

lastName = "Ferguson";
// this allows you to declare variables but it not a solid way to declare them. It creates a global property
