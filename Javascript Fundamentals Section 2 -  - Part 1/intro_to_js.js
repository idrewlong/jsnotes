// What is Javascript?
// Javascript is a high-level, object-oriented, multi-paradigm programming language

// Let's destructure the sentence
// - a programming language is basically a tool that allows a user to instruct a computer to do things
// - JS being a high level language means we don't have to worry about complex stuff like memory management
// - the language is mostly based on the concept of objects, for storing most kinds of data
// - JS is a very versatile language and can be used for different styles of programming

// The role of JS in web development
// 3 core technologies - HTML(nouns) - Content, CSS(adjectives) - Presentation, and JavaScript(verbs) - Functionality

// JS allows us to create dynamic effects and web applications in the browser
// JS frameworks include React, Angular, Vue, Svelte

// JS can run outside of browsers, such as servers like Node.js (backend applications)

// JS native applications - React and Ionic
