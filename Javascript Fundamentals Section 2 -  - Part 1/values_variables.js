// a value is a piece of data

// Examples:

//'Jonas' is a piece of data
// (23) is a value

let firstName = "Jonas";
//we declared a variable by providing a variable

// Don't start a variable name with an uppercase letter
let Person = "jonas";

// Variables in all uppercase are for constants that never change
let PI = 3.1415;

// Variable names need to be descriptive for cleaner code
let myFirstJob = "Programmer";
let myCurrentJob = "Teacher";

// vs

let job1 = "Programmer";
let job2 = "Teacher";

// the first option is cleaner code and easier to understand

//a variable is a box that is provided a declared value
